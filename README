JS2ME
=============

It's implementation of Java ME in JavaScript. I'm planning to use this as a part of J2ME for Firefox OS. Currently it only works under Chrome (it's easier to debug). Just launch Chrome with --allow-file-access-from-files option and open test.html.

Milestone 1 - Hello world (test.jar) works (done)
Milestone 2 - Picross (picross.jar) works
Milestone 3 - Make all my old J2ME projects working
Milestone 4 - Refactoring and Firefox OS application
Milestone 5 - ...
