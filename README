JS2ME
=============

It's implementation of Java ME in JavaScript. I'm planning to use this as a part of J2ME for Firefox OS. To use it in browser you must host it on some HTTP server and open launch.html.

Launch parameters:
src - path to jar file
width, height - size of display
fullHeight - height of fullscreen display
example: /launch.html?src=out/test.jar&width=320&height=240

Milestone 1 - Hello world (test.jar) works (done)
Milestone 2 - Picross (picross.jar) works (done)
Milestone 2.5 - Play around... (done)
Milestone 3 - Run FPC benchmark (http://www.dpsoftware.org/) (done)
Milestone 4 - Optimizations (done)
Milestone 5 - Firefox OS application (pending)
Milestone 6 - v. 0.6
 - performance (done, much better than expected!)
 - code quality
 - tests
 - loading screen
 - scroll
 - more?
Milestone X
 - Building blocks
 - MIDI support
 - M3G
