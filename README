JS2ME
=============

It's implementation of Java ME in JavaScript. I'm planning to use this as a part of J2ME for Firefox OS. To use it in browser you must host it on some HTTP server and open launch.html.

Launch parameters:
src - path to jar file
width, height - size of display
fullHeight - height of fullscreen display
app=[anything] - app mode (disables System.out.print)
example: /launch.html?src=out/test.jar&width=320&height=240
